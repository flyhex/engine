The resulting c++ class will live in mynamespace::db::MyTable . If you omit the namespace setting in your table definition, the class will live in db::MyTable . schema Specifies the schema name that should be used for the table. field A field describes a table column, the name, the type and so on. This block is enclosed by { and } . default The default value for the field. length Specifies the optional length of the field. notnull If this is specified, the field may not be null. operator The operator is taken into account when you execute an insert or update statement and hit a unique key violation. This can e.g. be used to increase or decrease points for particular keys. The first time you normally perform an insert - and the following times you will hit a key violation and thus perform the insert or update with the operator specified. The default operator is set .
